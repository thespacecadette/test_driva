# Tech test for Driva :)

1. Install and run `yarn`
2. Run `yarn mock-api` for BE
3. Run `yarn dev` for FE and open `http://localhost`

Enjoy! :)

Notes: I made this codebase myself for my own personal work over a year ago, and modified the base for this tech test. Happy to walk through in detail. It was done in a few hours (see commit history).
