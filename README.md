# Tech test for Driva :)

1. Install and run `yarn`
2. Run `yarn mock-api` for BE
3. Run `yarn dev` for FE and open `http://localhost`

## Notes
I still had some work left to do, which was the API endpoint (which I've integrated, and shows at the bottom of the page on submission, but isn't presented well).

I've done some testing (run `yarn test`) on front end, but none on BE as well. 

In terms of the BE api's I'd have been more modular and centralised with how I'd have written the API services (being mindful of middleware services/layers for security design).
